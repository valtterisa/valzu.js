# Valzu.js

**Valzu.js** is an open-source, lightweight fullâ€‘stack framework built with TypeScript and ES modules. It supports serverâ€‘side rendering with fileâ€‘based routing and clientâ€‘side hydrationâ€”allowing you to build modern, dynamic web applications with minimal configuration.

> **Note:**  
> Valzu.js is not built on React, though it uses similar component-based concepts. It uses a custom virtual DOM implementation where JSX (or direct calls to `createElement`) is converted into a virtual DOM that is rendered to HTML on the server and hydrated on the client.

---

## Features

- **Fileâ€‘Based Routing:**  
  Any file placed in the `/src/pages` directory becomes a route. For example, `index.tsx` maps to `/`, and `about.tsx` maps to `/about`.

- **Serverâ€‘Side Rendering (SSR):**  
  Dynamically renders pages on the server by converting your virtual DOM (created via `createElement`) into HTML.

- **Clientâ€‘Side Hydration:**  
  Hydrates the serverâ€‘rendered HTML on the client so that the page becomes interactive.

- **Custom Component System:**  
  Write components as plain functions that return virtual DOM nodes using your custom `createElement` function.

- **CLI Tool:**  
  Use the `create-valzu-app` CLI to quickly scaffold a new project with a pre-configured structure, including a development environment that supports hot reloading.

---

## Installation

### Publishing and Using the CLI

After publishing, you can create a new Valzu.js project using [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx):

```bash
npx create-valzu-app my-new-app
```

````

This command will:

- Scaffold a new project in the `my-new-app` directory.
- Automatically install all necessary dependencies.
- Provide you with a working development environment.

---

## Project Structure

Once you create a new project, your project folder should look similar to this:

```plaintext
my-new-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Project configuration and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ nodemon.json        # (Optional) nodemon configuration for development
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # HTML template (includes <link> to your CSS and <script> for the client bundle)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.css      # Your global styles
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ client.tsx      # Client entry file that calls the hydration function
    â”œâ”€â”€ server.ts       # Server entry file that starts the Valzu.js server
    â””â”€â”€ pages/          # Pages are auto-registered as routes
        â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts  # Home page
        â””â”€â”€ about.ts  # About page
```

---

## Usage

### Development Mode

1. **Navigate to Your Project:**

   ```bash
   cd my-new-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies (if not already done):**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Mode:**

   Run the following command to start both the client and server watchers:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   - **Client:**
     Esbuild watches your `src/client.tsx` file and rebuilds your client bundle (located in a hidden folder like `.build` or `dist`, based on your configuration) whenever changes are made.

   - **Server:**
     Nodemon with tsâ€‘node watches your server code and restarts the server automatically on changes.

4. **View Your App:**

   Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app live.

### Production Build

To build the production version of your client bundle and start your server from the built files:

1. **Build the Client Bundle:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will run your server from source (or, if you modify your build process, from a compiled output).

## Writing Components

You can write your components either by using plain function calls or JSX.

### Using Plain Function Calls

For example, hereâ€™s a component that uses your custom `createElement` function:

```typescript
import { createElement } from "valzu-core";

export default function WelcomePage() {
  return createElement(
    "div",
    { class: "home" },
    createElement("h1", {}, "ðŸš€ Welcome to Valzu.js!"),
    createElement("p", {}, "Your full-stack framework is ready to go."),
    createElement(
      "p",
      {},
      "Edit components/WelcomePage.ts to modify this page."
    ),
    createElement(
      "a",
      { href: "https://github.com/your-username/valzu.js", target: "_blank" },
      "ðŸ“– Read the Docs"
    )
  );
}
```

### Using JSX Syntax

If you prefer using JSX, add the JSX pragma at the top of your file:

```tsx
/** @jsx createElement */
import { createElement } from "valzu-core";

export default function WelcomePage() {
  return (
    <div className="home">
      <h1>ðŸš€ Welcome to Valzu.js!</h1>
      <p>Your full-stack framework is ready to go.</p>
      <p>Edit components/WelcomePage.ts to modify this page.</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/your-username/valzu.js" target="_blank">
        ðŸ“– Read the Docs
      </a>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The compiler converts this JSX into calls to your `createElement` function.

---

## Styling

Place your CSS files (e.g., `styles.css`) in the `public` folder and reference them in your HTML template:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" />
```

This allows your application to load and apply the styles when the HTML is served.

---

## Deployment

You can host your fullâ€‘stack application on various platforms, such as:

- **Heroku:**
  Great for Node.js servers with simple Git-based deployments.
- **Vercel or Netlify:**
  Excellent for static and hybrid apps; can also deploy serverless functions.
- **Cloud Providers:**
  AWS, GCP, or Azure provide full control over scaling and infrastructure.
- **Containers:**
  Use Docker and Kubernetes or Docker Compose for container-based deployments.

Refer to your chosen platformâ€™s documentation for specific deployment instructions.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **ESM vs. CommonJS:**
  Ensure that your `package.json` in `valzu-core` contains `"type": "module"` so that the built files are treated as ES modules.
- **Dynamic Imports on Windows:**
  If you encounter errors regarding file URL schemes (e.g., `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`), convert absolute paths to file URLs using `pathToFileURL` from the `url` module.
- **Dependency Issues:**
  If you have issues with CommonJS modules in an ES module environment, ensure that `"esModuleInterop": true` and `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true` are set in your tsconfig.
